# Koders Bot
This bot is not meant to be downloaded and used by just anybody. This exists for two different reasons:
1. The code is stored online in case of some event where somehow the files are lost from my local system.
2. Transparency with anyone on the Koders server. If you want to know how Koders works, you can view the source code. 

With those two points in mind, just know that in it's current state, it's a huge pile of spaghetti and is hard to follow ðŸ—¿
